 * Check whether a command is available on PATH.
 *
 * Uses the platform's native lookup utility — `which` on POSIX (always
 * available) and `where.exe` on Windows — so the test is fast and doesn't
 * actually execute the target binary. Shared by clipboard and terminal
 * detection to avoid duplicating the same `Bun.spawn([<lookup>, …])` pattern.
 *
 * The platform is an injectable parameter (default `process.platform`, the same
 * DI pattern as `power.ts` / `term-caps.ts`) so tests drive the win32-vs-POSIX
 * branch deterministically on any host. In tests, spawn is stubbed via the
 * shared `./test-helpers/bun-spawn-mock`.

 * Resolve a command to its full executable path via the same native lookup as
 * {@link commandExists} (`where.exe` on Windows, `which` on POSIX), capturing
 * the best match. Returns `null` when the command is not found or the lookup
 * fails. Used by the Windows opencode launcher to spawn the resolved path
 * (the SDK's bare-`opencode` spawn can't resolve a `.cmd`/`.ps1` shim).
 *
 * On Windows `where.exe` often lists a POSIX-style EXTENSIONLESS npm shim
 * (e.g. `…\npm\opencode`) BEFORE the spawnable `opencode.cmd`. CreateProcess
 * can't execute the extensionless file (it only appends `.exe`), so taking the
 * raw first match made `spawn` fail with `ENOENT` even though `opencode` ran
 * fine in a shell. {@link pickSpawnable} deprioritizes that shim — see it for
 * the ranking.
